# twitter-bot-app
This is an app that I made as an independent project. The app uses Node.js and Express.js to make API calls to the Twitter API, via an npm library for twitter called 'Twit'. The front-end is built using Pug and Bootstrap.
Express.js makes GET and POST requests to interact with the server. The 'Twit' library makes a GET call to the twitter API using my Twitter credentials. 
Once the data is fetched, node.js helps render the tweets to the front-end.
I am using Heroku deployment app to host this application. 

PS: I have regerated my Twitter credentials after uploading the code on Github for security reasons.
